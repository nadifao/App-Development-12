    <p style="font-size:19px">
        • Emperor penguins are the largest penguin species, reaching up to <b>120 cm</b> (nearly 4 feet) tall and weighing around <b>40 kg</b> (88 lbs).
        <br><br>
        • Male emperor penguins incubate their single egg by balancing it on their feet, covering it with a <b>brood pouch</b> for warmth.
        <br><br>
        • Their dense layer of feathers and a thick layer of blubber insulate them against <b>Antarctica's extreme cold</b>.
        <br><br>
        • Emperor penguins huddle in large groups to keep warm in temperatures as low as <b>-60°C</b> (-76°F).
        <br><br>
        • Emperor penguins are classified as <b>Near Threatened</b>, with <b>climate change</b> impacting their sea ice habitat.
        <br><br>
        • Each penguin has a unique vocal call to identify their mate and chicks in crowded colonies.
        <br><br>
        • Unlike other penguins, Emperor penguins carry their egg on their feet and don't build nests.
        <br><br>
        • They molt annually, growing new feathers to maintain their warmth and waterproofing.
        <br><br>
        • Their circulatory system helps conserve heat, ensuring they stay warm even in freezing temperatures.

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Where They Live</h2>
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        Emperor penguins live exclusively in <b>Antarctica</b>, enduring one of Earth's harshest climates.
        <br><br>
        They form colonies on the <b>sea ice</b>, where they breed and raise their young.
        <br><br>
        These penguins gather in large groups to shield themselves from the cold Antarctic winds.
        <br><br>
        The sea ice not only provides a safe breeding ground but also allows access to rich feeding grounds.

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">What They Eat</h2>
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        Emperor penguins are carnivores, mainly feeding on <b>fish</b>, <b>krill</b>, and <b>squid</b>.
        <br><br>
        They can dive as deep as <b>500 meters (1,640 feet)</b> and hold their breath for over <b>20 minutes</b>.
        <br><br>
        Their diet consists primarily of <b>Antarctic silverfish</b>, though they also consume squid and krill.
        <br><br>
        These penguins have dense, waterproof feathers that trap air close to their bodies, helping them stay warm and agile underwater.
