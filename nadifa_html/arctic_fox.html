<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:19px; colour=#031636; font-family: ClarendonBT-Light, Georgia, serif"> the arctic fox (also known as the white fox, polar fox or snow fox), mainly reside in the arctic and alpine tundra, meaning you could find them in Canada, Greenland, Iceland, and Russia.
<br>
The <b>arctic foxes</b> live a more <b>communal</b> and <b>nomadic life</b>, working with others to constantly scavenge for food.
<br>
These social creatures create elaborate <b>dens/burrows</b> for their family, which consists of one adult male, the litter, and two *vixens.
<br>
From their home, they dig around <b>4-8</b> different <b>entrances/exits</b>, connecting to a system of tunnels, which as a whole covers 30 square meters.
These dens not only provide shelter from the extreme cold but also serve as a safe place for raising their young. The pups are born in late spring and begin to emerge from the den in early summer, learning essential survival skills from their parents.


Their diet is varied, consisting of small mammals like lemmings, birds, and carrion, as well as berries and other vegetation when available. 

This adaptability in their diet allows them to thrive in an environment where food sources can be scarce.
<br>
<br>

The Arctic fox's keen senses and agile hunting skills make it a formidable predator despite its small size. 
<br>
They have excellent hearing, allowing them to detect prey beneath the snow. 
<br>

When hunting, they often use a technique called "pendulum hunting," where they leap high into the air and dive headfirst into the snow to catch their prey below. 
This unique hunting strategy showcases their remarkable adaptability and resilience in a challenging environment.
