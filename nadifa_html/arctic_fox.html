<br>
The <b>arctic foxes</b> live a more <b>communal</b> and <b>nomadic life</b>, working with others to constantly scavenge for food.
<br>
These social creatures create elaborate <b>dens/burrows</b> for their family, which consists of one adult male, the litter, and two *vixens.
<br>
From their home, they dig around <b>4-8</b> different <b>entrances/exits</b>, connecting to a system of tunnels, which as a whole covers 30 square meters.
