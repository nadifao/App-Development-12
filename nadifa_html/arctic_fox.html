<br>
<br>
<b>Arctic foxes</b> can reach sprinting speeds of up to <b>50 kph</b> (31 mph), making them fast hunters and excellent escape artists!
<br>
<br>
• They have <b>dark-coloured skin</b> underneath their thick <b>fur coats</b>, which helps them absorb and retain warmth in their frigid habitat.
<br>
<br>
• In the wild, arctic foxes have an average <b>lifespan</b> of <b>3–4 years</b>, although they can live longer in captivity.
<br>
<br>
• There are <b>8 recognized subspecies</b> of the arctic fox, each adapted to different regions of the Arctic and sub-Arctic.
<br>
<br>
• Due to <b>climate change</b>, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to hunt, as <b>snow cover</b> is diminishing, making it harder for their coats to blend into the environment.
<br>
<br>
• During the winter, arctic foxes grow a thick, fluffy <b>winter coat</b> that provides insulation in temperatures as low as <b>-50°C (-58°F)</b>. In summer, they shed this coat for a thinner one to stay cool.
<br>
<br>
• They are known for their impressive <b>hunting strategy</b>, using their acute sense of <b>hearing</b> to locate prey under snow. They pounce through the snow, breaking through the surface to catch small animals like <b>lemmings</b> and <b>voles</b>.
<br>
<br>
• Arctic foxes are highly adaptable and can scavenge leftovers from larger predators like <b>polar bears</b>. They’ve also been observed storing extra food for later use, burying it in the snow.
<br>
<br>
• These foxes are <b>monogamous</b>, typically mating for life. Both the male and female help raise their litter, which can contain up to <b>10–14 pups</b>.
<br>
<br>
• Despite their small size, arctic foxes are known to travel vast distances—sometimes more than <b>1,500 kilometers (930 miles)</b>—in search of food, shelter, or new territory.

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">where they live</h2>
<p style="font-size:19px"> the arctic fox (also known as the white fox, polar fox or snow fox), mainly reside in the arctic and alpine tundra, meaning you could find them in Canada, Greenland, Iceland, and Russia.
<br>
The <b>arctic fox</b> (also known as the <b>white fox</b>, <b>polar fox</b>, or <b>snow fox</b>) primarily resides in the <b>Arctic</b> and <b>alpine tundra</b>. These regions include parts of <b>Canada</b>, <b>Greenland</b>, <b>Iceland</b>, <b>Russia</b>, and other cold, barren landscapes.
<br>
<br>
Arctic foxes live a <b>communal</b> and <b>nomadic lifestyle</b>, working with others to constantly scavenge for food in their harsh environment. Their ability to thrive in these extreme conditions is partly due to their social behavior and cooperative hunting.
<br>
<br>
These social creatures create <b>elaborate dens</b> or <b>burrows</b> for their families, typically consisting of one adult male, the litter of pups, and two <b>vixens</b> (females). These dens are carefully designed, with around <b>4–8 entrances/exits</b> leading to an intricate system of <b>tunnels</b>. The entire network can cover up to <b>30 square meters</b>, providing both protection and convenience.
<br>
<br>
These dens serve multiple purposes: they offer <b>shelter</b> from the extreme cold and provide a <b>safe space</b> for raising their young. The pups are usually born in <b>late spring</b> and begin to emerge from the den in <b>early summer</b>. During this time, they learn <b>essential survival skills</b> from their parents, such as hunting and evading predators.
<br>
<br>
In addition to creating a secure home, arctic foxes are also known for their ability to <b>migrate long distances</b> when food becomes scarce. They often follow larger predators, like <b>polar bears</b>, scavenging leftover food to survive. These burrows, passed down through generations, play a crucial role in their ability to endure some of the coldest environments on Earth.

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center" >what they eat</h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">
<br>                                                                                                       
<br>
The diet of an <b>arctic fox</b> is varied, consisting of small <b>mammals</b> like <b>lemmings</b>, <b>birds</b>, and <b>carrion</b> (decaying animal flesh). During the summer months, they supplement their diet with <b>berries</b> and other <b>vegetation</b>, showcasing their remarkable adaptability. This flexibility allows them to thrive in environments where <b>food sources</b> are often scarce and unpredictable.
<br>                                                                                                       
<br>
The <b>arctic fox’s</b> keen senses and agile hunting skills make it a <b>formidable predator</b>, despite its small size. They possess excellent <b>hearing</b>, which enables them to detect prey hidden beneath the snow. Once prey is located, the fox uses a fascinating hunting technique called <b>"pendulum hunting."</b> In this strategy, the fox leaps high into the air and dives <b>headfirst</b> into the snow, breaking through the surface to grab its target below.
<br>                                                                                                       
<br>
This unique hunting behavior not only highlights their <b>precision</b> but also demonstrates their <b>adaptability</b> and <b>resilience</b> in one of the world’s harshest climates. When food is especially scarce, they scavenge leftovers from larger predators like <b>polar bears</b>, ensuring their survival through tough winters.
