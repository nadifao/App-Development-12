<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Fun Facts</h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">
<br>
<br>
• Belugas are <b>opportunistic feeders</b>, meaning they eat a wide variety of prey depending on what’s available. They use <b>echolocation</b>—a biological sonar system—to locate prey even in <b>murky waters</b> or under <b>thick ice</b>!
<br>
<br>
• <b>Adult belugas</b> are known for their <b>pure white</b> coloration, which helps them blend into icy environments. However, <b>calves</b> are born <b>grey</b> and gradually lighten over their first few years of life, typically reaching full white coloration by the age of five.
<br>
<br>
• Unlike many other whales, belugas lack a <b>dorsal fin</b>. This adaptation makes it easier for them to <b>swim under ice</b> without getting snagged or injured. Another unique feature is their <b>flexible neck</b>, allowing them to move their heads independently—useful for navigating and hunting in tight spaces. Their large, rounded forehead, called a <b>melon</b>, can change shape to aid both in <b>communication</b> and fine-tuning their echolocation abilities.
<br>
<br>
• <b>Beluga whales</b> are classified as <b>Near Threatened</b> by the <b>IUCN</b> (International Union for Conservation of Nature), though some regional populations are considered <b>endangered</b>. They face several threats, including <b>climate change</b>, <b>habitat loss</b>, <b>pollution</b>, and <b>hunting</b> in certain regions. Conservation efforts are vital to ensure their survival.
<br>
<br>
• Belugas are often called the "canaries of the sea" due to their wide range of <b>vocalizations</b>, which include clicks, whistles, and chirps. They use these sounds for <b>communication</b> with one another and for <b>navigating</b> their environment.
<br>
<br>
• They are highly <b>social animals</b>, living in groups called <b>pods</b> that usually consist of 10–20 individuals. These pods can merge, forming superpods of several hundred whales, especially during migrations or in areas with abundant food.
<br>
<br>
• Unlike many other whale species, belugas are comfortable in both <b>saltwater</b> and <b>freshwater</b> environments. Some belugas travel far upriver, swimming hundreds of kilometers inland, which is rare behavior for marine mammals.
<br>
<br>
• Beluga whales have been observed blowing <b>bubbles</b>, possibly for play or communication. They are also known for their curious and playful nature, often approaching boats and interacting with humans.
<br>
<br>
• Belugas can hold their breath for up to <b>25 minutes</b> during deep dives. However, they usually dive to more moderate depths of around <b>20–40 meters</b> when searching for food.
<br>
<br>
• The lifespan of a beluga whale in the wild is typically <b>30 to 50 years</b>. However, threats like pollution and climate change can affect their longevity.

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">where they live</h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">

<br>
<br>
Beluga whales are well-adapted to life in cold waters, with their iconic <b>milky white</b> coloration helping them blend seamlessly into the icy <b>Arctic environment</b>. They inhabit regions throughout the <b>Arctic Ocean</b> and the <b>sub-Arctic seas</b>, including parts of the <b>Beaufort Sea</b>, <b>Bering Sea</b>, <b>Chukchi Sea</b>, and <b>Hudson Bay</b>.
<br>
<br>
<b>Coastal and Shallow Waters</b>
Belugas typically prefer <b>shallow coastal areas</b>, which provide both safety from predators and abundant feeding opportunities. They are often found near <b>inlets</b>, <b>bays</b>, and <b>estuaries</b>, where food sources such as <b>fish</b>, <b>squid</b>, and <b>crustaceans</b> thrive.
<br>
<br>
<b>Summer Migrations</b>
During the warmer summer months, beluga whales migrate to <b>river mouths</b> and <b>estuaries</b>, including the <b>St. Lawrence River</b> in Canada and the <b>Amur River</b> in Russia. These areas offer warmer, <b>brackish waters</b>, where they molt (shed their skin) and raise their calves. Some groups travel hundreds of kilometers inland, making belugas unique among whales for their tolerance to <b>freshwater</b>.
<br>
<br>
<b>Winter Range</b>
In winter, Beluga whales may move to deeper <b>offshore waters</b> to avoid ice trapping. However, they are known for their ability to navigate under <b>pack ice</b>, using cracks or <b>leads</b> (openings) in the ice to breathe.
<br>
<br>
<b>Regional Populations</b>
<b>Canadian Arctic</b>: Found near the Hudson Bay, Cumberland Sound, and the Mackenzie Delta.
<b>Russian Arctic</b>: Populations thrive in the White, Kara, and Barents Seas.
<b>Alaska</b>: Belugas inhabit Cook Inlet and the Beaufort and Bering Seas.
Beluga whales' ability to live in diverse environments—ranging from <b>saltwater oceans</b> to <b>freshwater rivers</b>—highlights their remarkable adaptability. However, their habitat is increasingly affected by <b>climate change</b>, which alters ice patterns and impacts food availability, posing a growing threat to these fascinating creatures.

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">what they eat</h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">

<br>
<br>
Beluga whales are <b>carnivores</b>, meaning their diet consists entirely of <b>meat</b>. They feed on a variety of <b>fish</b>, such as <b>salmon</b>, <b>herring</b>, <b>cod</b>, and <b>smelt</b>. Their food preferences can vary based on the season and availability, with fish playing a crucial role during the summer months when they migrate to coastal waters.
<br>
<br>
In addition to fish, belugas consume <b>squid</b>, <b>octopuses</b>, and <b>marine worms</b>, as well as small <b>crustaceans</b> like <b>shrimp</b>, <b>crabs</b>, and <b>amphipods</b>. These opportunistic feeders hunt in both <b>shallow coastal areas</b> and deeper waters, adjusting their diet according to what’s accessible in their habitat.
<br>
<br>
Belugas use their highly developed <b>echolocation</b> abilities to locate prey in murky waters or under ice. Once prey is found, they rely on their <b>flexible neck</b> and powerful jaws to grasp and swallow it whole, as they don’t have teeth designed for chewing.
<br>
<br>
Due to their varied diet, belugas play a vital role in maintaining the <b>balance of marine ecosystems</b>. However, environmental changes that affect the abundance of their prey—such as <b>overfishing</b> or <b>rising water temperatures</b>—can threaten the availability of food, impacting their health and survival.
