<h2>Beluga Whale </h2>
<p>Beluga Whales are known for their milky white colouration, allowing them to blend into their Arctic and sub-Arctic environments.

  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Fun Facts</h2>
  <p style ="font-size: 20px;">

• The beluga is closely related to the narwhal; they are the only two members of the Monodontidae family.
<br>
<br>

• Beluga whales' dives may last up to 25 minutes and can reach depths of 800 meters.
<br>
<br>

• The word beluga comes from the Russian word "bielo" meaning white. However, these white whales are born dark gray. It can take up to eight years before they turn completely white.
<br>
<br>

• The beluga is able to swim backwards.
<br>
<br>

• The beluga can change the shape of its bulbous forehead, called a "melon",  by blowing air around its sinuses.
<br>
<br>
• In 2009, a captive beluga whale rescued a distressed participant of a free diving competition by pushing her to the surface.
<br>
<br>
• Belugas, like other arctic whales, do not have dorsal fins (a dorsal fin causes extra heat loss and would be a major hindrance in the arctic ice), but they do have a tough dorsal ridge. They also have a thick layer of blubber that insulates them from the icy arctic waters.
<br>
<br>
• The vertebrae in a beluga’s neck is not fused together, giving it the unusual ability to turn its head up, down and side-to-side.
 Threats to beluga whales include climate change, hunting, oil and gas development, and industrial and urban pollution. Polar bears and killer whales are known predators of belugas throughout their Arctic range.

<section id="wtl">
<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">where they live</h2>
<p style ="font-size: 20px;">

<br>
They inhabit the <b>Arctic Ocean</b> and adjoining seas, often found in shallow coastal waters.
<br>
They are also known to migrate to <b>estuaries</b> and rivers during summer months, tolerating brackish water.
<br>

<section id="wte">

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center" >what they eat</h2>
<p style ="font-size: 20px;">
Beluga whales are <b>carnivores</b>, feeding on a variety of fish (such as salmon and herring), squid, shrimp, and other crustaceans.
<br>
They are opportunistic feeders, using echolocation to locate prey even in murky waters!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


Adults are pure white, while calves are born grey and gradually lighten over the first few years.
Belugas lack a dorsal fin, making it easier for them to swim under ice. They have a flexible neck and large forehead (melon), which can change shape to aid communication and echolocation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Beluga whales are classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN, with some populations considered endangered. They are threatened by climate change, habitat loss, pollution, and hunting in certain regions.
