<h1 style="h1">Beluga Whale </h1>
<p>Beluga Whales are known for their milky white colouration, allowing them to blend into their Arctic and sub-Arctic environments.

<br>
They inhabit the <b>Arctic Ocean</b> and adjoining seas, often found in shallow coastal waters. 
<br>
They are also known to migrate to <b>estuaries</b> and rivers during summer months, tolerating brackish water.
<br>
<br>
Beluga whales are <b>carnivores</b>, feeding on a variety of fish (such as salmon and herring), squid, shrimp, and other crustaceans. 
<br>
They are opportunistic feeders, using echolocation to locate prey even in murky waters!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


Adults are pure white, while calves are born grey and gradually lighten over the first few years.
Belugas lack a dorsal fin, making it easier for them to swim under ice. They have a flexible neck and large forehead (melon), which can change shape to aid communication and echolocation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Beluga whales are classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN, with some populations considered endangered. They are threatened by climate change, habitat loss, pollution, and hunting in certain regions.
